# Animal Magic

This script allows the Bitty Blue "Animal Magic" feature to be used. It includes the Bluetooth button service and displays "C" when a Bluetooth connection has been established and "D" when it is closed.

To use this script:

1. Go to the MakeCode web site at https://makecode.microbit.org
2. Create a new project with a name of your choice
3. In Advanced, select Extensions and then select the Bluetooth extension. Agree to remove the Radio extension when prompted.
4. Go into the project settings (cog icon, top right) and disable pairing. Re-enable it later if you have a need for security.
5. Switch to the JavaScript editor.
6. Copy and paste the script from the bitty_blue_animal_magic.js file into your MakeCode JavaScript window.
7. Download the code as a hex file. Copy it onto your micro:bit over USB.
8. Start Bitty Blue. Scan to detect your micro:bit and select it to connect to it. A "C" should appear on the micro:bit display.
9. Select the Animal Magic icon.
10. Press the A and B buttons on your device, one at a time. Be amazed.
