# Temperature Monitor

This script allows the Bitty Blue "Temperature Monitor" feature to be used. It displays "C" when a Bluetooth connection has been established and "D" when it is closed. Adjust the code to suit your purposes.

To use this script:

1. Go to the MakeCode web site at https://makecode.microbit.org
2. Create a new project with a name of your choice
3. In Advanced, select Extensions and then select the Bluetooth extension. Agree to remove the Radio extension when prompted.
4. Go into the project settings (cog icon, top right) and disable pairing. Re-enable it later if you have a need for security.
5. Switch to the JavaScript editor.
6. Copy and paste the script from the bitty_blue_temperature_monitoring.js file into your MakeCode JavaScript window.
7. Download the code as a hex file. Copy it onto your micro:bit over USB.
8. Start Bitty Blue. Scan to detect your micro:bit and select it to connect to it. A "C" should appear on the micro:bit display.
9. Select the Temperature Monitor icon.
10. Warm your micro:bit up by breathing on it (or some other *safe* method).
